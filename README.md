seasaltdev --> Where food meets big data
==========

Small businesess, order their products from various vendors accross th globe. I, myself, work in a restaurant which works with many vendors across US. Ordering products, up until today, is done by calling the vendors directly. Human errors are the main problem to this method. There are plenty of times where the orders got mistaken, and the delivery get all wrong. So the following questions ensues :

- What if we can create an ecosystem where businesess and vendors can communicate clearer, where everything is visual, data driven information?
- If so, how can we implement the ecosystem the work together with the existing social media services? Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.
- What if we can increase productivity by looking at past performance, graphs, charts?

Those are the initial questions that drive the creation of this project. The target completion date would be the end of year 2014 ( 6 months from now).
